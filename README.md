# Cluttered-Dir-Cleaning-Util

This Utility has two parts-

1. The utility will scan all the directory for the user recursively and
   display top 10 largest files on the system

2. The utility will sort the files on path/Desktop on the basis of file extension and move them in
   separate folders in Documents folder. For example: If there are 10 MP3 files, 3 word documents, 4 PDFs then in Documents Folder three folders should be created with name MP3, DOC and PDF and all the files on the path/Desktop should be moved into these directories based on their file type or extension. Desktop/path will be cleaned but it will not remove folders and shortcuts of any application.

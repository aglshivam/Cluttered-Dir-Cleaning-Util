# Cluttered-Dir-Cleaning-Util

This Utility has two parts-

1. The utility will scan all the directory for the user recursively and
   display top 10 largest files on the system

2. The utility will sort the files on Desktop on the basis of file extension and move them in
   separate folders in Documents folder. For example: If there are 10 MP3 files, 3 word documents, 4 PDFs then in Documents Folder three folders should be created with name MP3, DOC and PDF and all the files on the Desktop should be moved into these directories based on their file type or extension. Desktop will be cleaned but it will not remove folders and shortcuts of any application.
